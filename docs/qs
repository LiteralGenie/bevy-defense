- channels
    - gui needs game state
        - serialize and emit to gui after each tick
        - events if necessary (ugly but whatever)
    - gui needs to render stuff (eg placeholder for drag drop)
        - gui emits events
    - gui needs to cache render-related state
        - ??? shadow resource?
